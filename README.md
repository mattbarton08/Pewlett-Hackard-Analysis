## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
According to our data, there are 41,381 employees close to or at retirement age. All of those roles will need to be filled in the near future. <br>

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are only 1,940 employees who fit the criteria for the mentorship program. It might be in the company's best interest to open the mentorship program up to younger employees, and give each mentor a group of employees to support so that there are enough mentors. <br><br>
